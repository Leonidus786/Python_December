# In Case of binary search ---
# How it works:

# Check the value in the center of the array.
# If the target value is lower, search the left half of the array. If the target value is higher, search the right half.
# Continue step 1 and 2 for the new reduced part of the array until the target value is found or until the search area is empty.
# If the value is found, return the target value index. If the target value is not found, return -1.
